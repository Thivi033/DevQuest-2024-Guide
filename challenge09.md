# Challenge 9

## Overview

The challenge is based on retrieving and sorting feedbacks for a movie. It has 3 sub challenges:

a. Get all feedback for a movie
b. Show top 2 rated and bottom 2 rated feedbacks for a movie
c. Sort feedbacks

## a. Get all feedback for a movie

The `getAllFeedbackForMovie()` function in the `feedbackRepository` retrieves all feedback for a movie from the database. After retrieving the feedback, it uses the `modifyFeedbackResponse()` function from the `feedbackController` to:

1. Convert the `createdAt` attribute of each feedback object to a "days ago" format.
2. Add the user's fullname to each feedback object.
3. Remove movieId from the feedback object.

Finally, it returns the modified feedback.

However, there are some bugs in the current implementation:

1. The `createdAt` attribute of each feedback object is in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ`. It should be converted to a "days ago" format.

2. The `name` attribute of each feedback object is the `userId` of the user. It should be converted to the full name of the user.  

You need to fix these bugs in the `modifyFeedbackResponse()` function in the `feedbackController`.

The request should be a `GET` request to `/api/feedback/movie/:movieId`.

**Response for the `GET  /api/feedback/movie/6ba1472e-563c-4dbd-ad31-d78aec32f5af`**

            "comment": "Fun to watch",
            "createdAt": "Today"
        }
  ]
}
```

## b. Show top 2 rated and bottom 2 rated feedbacks for a movie

On the movie page of the application, the default feedbacks displayed should be the two feedbacks with the highest ratings and the two feedbacks with the lowest ratings for the respective movie.

In this challenge you need to implement the `getTopBottomFeedbacks()` function in the `/controller/feedbackController.js` file to get the two highest rated feedbacks and two lowest rated feedbacks. You can use the `getAllFeedbackForMovie()` function in the `/repositories/feedbackRepository.js` file to get all feedbacks for a movie.

**Then retrieve the two highest rated feedbacks and two lowest rated feedbacks and sort the feedbacks from lowest to highest rating.**

**Note - If there are 4 or fewer feedbacks for a movie, return all the feedbacks from lowest to highest rating.**

Next, using the `modifyFeedbackResponse()` function, convert the createdAt attribute of a feedback object to days ago format and return the modified response.

The request should be a `GET` request to `/api/feedback/movie/top-bottom/:movieId`.

**Response for the `GET  /api/feedback/movie/top-bottom/6ba1472e-563c-4dbd-ad31-d78aec32f5af`**

## c. Sort feedbacks

In the movie page of the application, the user should be able to sort feedback based on time and rating and retrieve first 4 feedbacks.

Use `GET /api/feedback/movie/sort/${movieId}/?option=${option}&order=${order}` to sort feedbacks. The `option` parameter can be either `time` or `rating`, while the `sort` parameter can be `asc` or `desc`.

This can be divided into 4 sub-challenges:

1. Sort from newest to oldest feedbacks
   **Request-**`GET /api/feedback/movie/sort/:movieId/time/desc`
   **Response for**`GET /api/feedback/movie/sort/6ba1472e-563c-4dbd-ad31-d78aec32f5af/time/desc`
